## by Motunrayo Ilawole


## Dataset
> This document talks about exploring a dataset that includes information about individual rides made in a bike system of the San Francisco Bay area.
The source data is available at https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data.
The Features included in the Data are as follows :

* User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
* Trip Duration(in seconds)
* Bike ID
* Start Time and Date
* End Time and Date
* Start Station ID
* End Station ID
* Start Station Name
* End Station Name
* End Station Latitude
* End Station Longitude
* Start Station Latitude
* Start Station Longitude

> I coverted the duration in seconds to duration in minutes and duration in hours in order to explore better.

## Questions to be answered:
1. What are the factors that affect trip duration?
1. When are most trips taken, in terms of days, weeks, or months?
2. What is the average duration of trips?
3.Does the customer being either a suscriber or a customer affect the duration of trips?

## Summary of Findings
I tried to find out what the key factors affecting trip duration were.

I discovered that months do not have a big effect on the trip duration, but user type does have an impact on trip duration. 
According to the analysis, I found that customers tend to rent the bikes for longer trips ( generally above 300 minutes) than Subscribers.
